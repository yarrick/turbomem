turbomem - Linux driver for Intel(R) Turbo Memory Controller


This is the development of a reverse-engineered Linux driver for the Intel(R)
Turbo Memory Controller, a mini-PCIe board that contains NAND flash and a
controller chip. This driver will expose the flash memory to the Linux MTD
(Memory Technology Device) layer, which in turn can setup filesystems on top.

After detecting a compatible device, basic info is logged to dmesg:
turbomem 0000:04:00.0: Found Intel Turbo Memory Controller (rev 11)
turbomem 0000:04:00.0: Device characteristics: 13404, flash size: 2048 MB


Current status:
---------------
Erasing, writing and reading works, bad block handling is done.
Driver passes mtd_pagetest and ubi tests.
Device is mountable with ubifs, but does not work properly.

How to format and mount:
------------------------
1. Install mtd-utils from http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/
2. Load MTD support
   # modprobe mtd
3. Load driver (creates /dev/mtd0)
   # insmod turbomem.ko
4. Format device for UBI (only needed first time)
   # ubiformat /dev/mtd0
5. Load UBI support
   # modprobe ubi
6. Attach UBI device to stack (creates /dev/ubi0)
   # ubiattach -p /dev/mtd0
7. Show info about UBI device (only needed first time)
   Get size of device for next step
     (Amount of available logical eraseblocks, bytes)
   # ubinfo /dev/ubi0
8. Create UBIFS volume on top of ubi0
   (creates /dev/ubi0_0, only needed first time)
   size = 2037456896 for 2GB. name is required but does not matter
   # ubimkvol -s <size> -N <name> /dev/ubi0
9. Mount UBIFS
   # mount -t ubifs /dev/ubi0_0 /mnt/turbomem
10. Now test reading/writing in your mounted directory

Notes:
------
* When module is loaded, eraseblocks 1-5 will be scanned for a bad block table.
  If none is found, all non-reserved eraseblocks will be erased to gather info
  on which blocks are bad. The data will be written twice at blocks 1-5.

* If you use both Linux and Windows on the computer with this card, uninstall
  the Turbo Memory driver in Windows before using this driver. Windows and
  Linux drivers use different bad block tables and will erase all flash.

* The supplied Vista driver requires certain SATA controller chips to install
  and work. Since this driver does no disk filtering hopefully the Turbo Memory
  will work in any board with a mini-PCIe connector.

* This driver is developed using the 2GB version of the board. If the 1 and 4GB
  versions use the same flash layout they should also work, otherwise some
  adjustment will be needed. Get in touch if you run into problems.
